# AWS Cloud Cost Optimization - Identifying and Removing Stale EBS Snapshots

**Introduction**

Managing cloud costs is a key aspect of maintaining an efficient and optimized AWS infrastructure. Unused or stale resources can accumulate over time, leading to unnecessary expenses. One such resource is Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) snapshots, which are used for backup and recovery but can become orphaned when associated volumes are no longer linked to active EC2 instances.
To address this issue, we can leverage AWS Lambda and the Boto3 library to automate the identification and deletion of stale EBS snapshots, ensuring efficient storage cost optimization. This article outlines the importance of identifying stale snapshots, how to implement a Lambda function for cleanup, and best practices for maintaining a cost-efficient AWS environment.

**Requirements**

Before implementing the Lambda function, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

**AWS Account:** An active AWS account with permissions to manage EC2 instances and EBS snapshots.

**IAM Role for Lambda:** The Lambda function must have an IAM role with the necessary permissions to:
  1. List and delete EBS snapshots.
  2. Describe EC2 instances.
     
**Boto3 Library:** The function will use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to interact with AWS services.

**Amazon CloudWatch Events:** To automate execution, configure a CloudWatch rule to trigger the Lambda function at regular intervals.

**Implementing the AWS Lambda Function**

The following Python script leverages Boto3 to identify and delete stale EBS snapshots:

**delete_snapshots.py**

**How It Works**
1. Retrieve Active EC2 Instances: The script fetches all running and stopped EC2 instances and extracts the associated volume IDs.
2. Fetch Owned Snapshots: It retrieves all EBS snapshots owned by the AWS account.
3. Identify Stale Snapshots: The script checks if a snapshotâ€™s associated volume is not linked to any active EC2 instance.
4. Delete Stale Snapshots: If a snapshot is identified as stale, it is deleted to optimize storage costs.

**Automating Execution with AWS CloudWatch**
To automate the execution of this Lambda function:
1. Navigate to AWS CloudWatch.
2. Create a CloudWatch Event Rule with a Schedule Expression (e.g., rate(1 day)).
3. Set the target as the Lambda function.
4. Enable the rule to trigger the Lambda function at the specified intervals.

**Best Practices for AWS Cost Optimization**

Implement Lifecycle Policies: Use AWS Data Lifecycle Manager to automate snapshot retention and deletion.
Monitor Costs Regularly: Use AWS Cost Explorer to analyze storage usage trends.
Use AWS Trusted Advisor: Trusted Advisor can help identify unused resources across AWS services.
Tag Resources: Implement tagging policies to categorize and track snapshots effectively.

**Conclusion**

By automating the identification and removal of stale EBS snapshots, AWS users can significantly reduce unnecessary storage costs and maintain a lean, efficient cloud infrastructure. This Lambda-based solution provides a scalable, event-driven approach to AWS cost optimization, ensuring that storage resources are used effectively without manual intervention.
